<b>J-Pilot User Manual</b></h2></center>

<p><br><b>J-Pilot</b> is a palm pilot desktop for Linux/Unix written by:
<br>Judd Montgomery, judd@engineer.com, <a href="http://jpilot.linuxbox.com">http://jpilot.linuxbox.com</a>
<br>J-Pilot has been reported to work on:
<ul>
<li>
Linux</li>

<li>
Solaris</li>

<li>
Irix</li>

<li>
FreeBSD</li>
</ul>
J-Pilot should work with Palm Pilot models 1000, 5000, Personal, Professional,
III, IIIx, IIIe, V, and VII.
<h3>
Purpose of this document</h3>
Many things in this document are pretty much self explanatory, like a lot
of the text on how to use J-Pilot.&nbsp; I have written this document for
a user as well as someone who is thinking about being a user and wants
to know the capabilities of J-Pilot before much time is wasted downloading
and compiling it, etc.&nbsp; In the using J-Pilot section, I have marked
some things with "<u><font color="#FF0000">*Hint*</font></u>"<font color="#000000">
that I think may not be right away obvious to a new user.&nbsp; If you
are in a hurry, just read these.</font>
<h3>
Installation</h3>

<h4>
Prerequisites</h4>

<li>
GTK+, and glib (installed by default on most Linux distributions)</li>

<li>
pilot-link (comes with many distributions)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>To compile J-Pilot you need to have GTK+1.2 or later installed.&nbsp;
You can find out what version you have by running "gtk-config --version".&nbsp;
GTK+ requires glib.&nbsp; The glib version probably should match the gtk
version.&nbsp; You can also do a "glib-config --version".&nbsp; You can
get these at <a href="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</a>
<p>Pilot link must be installed and working.&nbsp; What I mean by working
is that you can use pilot-xfer, memos, or some other pilot-link program.
<p>David Silber has some pretty good documentation for using Palm Pilots
with Linux at <a href="http://www.orbits.com/Palm/">http://www.orbits.com/Palm/</a>.
<p>The pilot-link code can be found at <a href="ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/">ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/</a>
<p>If you are installing pilot-link from RPMs make sure that you also have
the pilot-link-dev rpm installed for the header files so that J-Pilot can
compile.
<h4>
Compiling</h4>
To compile and install do the following:
<br>./configure
<br>make
<br>make install
<br>jpilot
<p>For Japanese support, use ./configure --with-japanese.
<br>./configure --help will list all the options available.
<p>make uninstall is also an option, however I do not recommend using this
;)
<p>I have included a spec file so if you want to create your own RPM all
you have to do is "rpm -tb jpilot-0.96.tar.gz"
<p>J-Pilot was written in such a way that it should be very safe to sync.&nbsp;
There is always the possibility of something going wrong though.&nbsp;
As with anything else, backup your data if you cannot afford to lose it.&nbsp;
Just make sure your backup software doesn't destroy it first.
<h4>
Serial Port Setup</h4>
When syncing, J-Pilot uses the port and speed settings out of the J-Pilot
preferences screen.&nbsp; If the port is blank then J-Pilot will use the
PILOTPORT environment variables, as does pilot-link.&nbsp; If these are
blank also then J-Pilot will default to /dev/pilot.
<p>It is recommended, but not necessary to make a link from /dev/pilot
to the correct serial port.&nbsp; So, if your cradle is on COM1, this is
/dev/ttyS0 under Linux.&nbsp; You could execute the command "ln -s /dev/ttyS0
/dev/pilot".&nbsp; COM2 is /dev/ttyS1, and so on.&nbsp; The Linux serial
ports cua[n] are going away.&nbsp; You should use the ttyS[n] ports instead.
<p>You must also give non-root users permissions to access the serial port.&nbsp;
The command to do this is (as root) "chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0" for the first
serial port, ttyS1, for the second, and so on.
<h3>
Color Files</h3>
Make install will copy a few default color files to /usr/local/share/jpilot/
(unless you told configure to use another prefix).&nbsp; These will be
selectable from the preferences menu.&nbsp; Also J-Pilot will look in $HOME/.jpilot/
for colors files.&nbsp; They must start with "jpilotrc".&nbsp; If you want
to add new ones, or modify the current ones, just put the files in one
of these directories and they will show up in the preferences menu.
<p>If you create your own cool jpilotrc files feel free to send them back
to me and if I like it, I'll include it in the release.
<h3>
Use of the HOME environment variable</h3>
Normally, you can just leave HOME alone.
<p>J-Pilot uses the HOME environment variable to make it easy to allow
multiple pilots to be synced under the same user.&nbsp; Just set HOME to
the directory you want J-Pilot to use.&nbsp; For example, I have 2 palm
pilots.&nbsp; I can sync the one I use all the time into /home/judd.&nbsp;
The other one I can sync into
<br>/home/judd/palm2 by using this script:
<br>#!/bin/bash
<br>HOME=/home/judd/palm2
<br>jpilot
<p>This is also handy for syncing xcopilot into its own directory.
<h3>
Oops, Reverting</h3>
You can always make the databases revert back to the last time that the
pilot was synced.&nbsp; All you have to do is "rm ~/.jpilot/*.pc".&nbsp;
Deleted records will come back, modified records will be un-modified, etc.&nbsp;
Nothing is permanent until the sync/backup.&nbsp; You can do this if you
make a mistake, or just to play around with J-Pilot and then delete the
changed records without syncing them.&nbsp; For example if you want to
restore the addresses to their last sync state you can remove ~/.jpilot/AddressDB.pc.
<p>Also, from the preferences menu, you can choose to show deleted records
and then click on the deleted record and use "Add" to get a copy of it
back.

The "Case Sensitive" checkbox can be clicked for a case sensitive search.&nbsp;
A list of found strings will be listed in the window.&nbsp; Just click
on these records and the J-Pilot main window will go to the application
and the record that matches the one that was selected.
<h3>
Installing files to the Palm Pilot</h3>
<img SRC="jpilot-install.gif" NOSAVE height=567 width=441>
<p>The files entered here will be installed during the next sync.&nbsp;
J-Pilot just keeps a pointer to the file, not a copy, so you shouldn't
move the file, or delete it until after a sync.&nbsp; Just browse through
the directory structure and select the files you are wishing to install.&nbsp;
You can either double-click on them, or press the "Add" button after they
are selected.&nbsp; They will show up in the "Files to be installed" window.&nbsp;
You can always remove them from the "Files to be installed" window by selecting
them and pressing the "Remove" button.&nbsp; When you are done press the
"Done" button.
<h3>
Preferences screen</h3>
<img SRC="jpilot-prefs.gif" NOSAVE height=303 width=340>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Choose the localization for the abbreviated dates feild.</li>

<li>
Choose the localization for the long dates field.</li>

<li>
Choose the localization of the time field.</li>

<li>
<font color="#FF0000">*<u>Hint</u>* </font>Some displays will flicker with
every change of the clock, so you may not want the clock updating every
second.&nbsp; In this case, choose one of the time settings without seconds.&nbsp;
Then the time will update every minute.</li>

<li>
Choose the first day of the week.&nbsp; The next time the calendar is re-drawn
it will use the this day of the week to start the week on.</li>

<li>
Select a GTK colors file.&nbsp; J-Pilot must be restarted for this change
to take effect.</li>

<li>
Set the serial port.&nbsp; If this is empty, then the environment variable
PILOTPORT will be used.&nbsp; If PILOTPORT is not set then the default
of /dev/pilot is used.</li>

<li>
Set the serial rate.&nbsp; Some computers will not sync reliably above
9600.&nbsp; I am not sure why this is.</li>

<li>
Set "show deleted records".&nbsp; Having this box checked means that deleted
records will still be displayed as a different color.&nbsp; This can be
confusing at times.</li>

<li>
Set "show modified deleted records".&nbsp; Having this box checked means
that when a record is modified the original record will still be displayed
as a different color.&nbsp; This can be very confusing at times.</li>

<h3>
Quit</h3>
To quit the program, use the quit button, or quit from the menu.&nbsp;
You should not quit the program by killing its window.&nbsp; This causes
a harsh death and the cleanup routines will not be executed.
<h3>
Sync</h3>
The sync button will sync four the main applications and any plugins that
are installed.
<h3>
Backup</h3>
This will sync the main applications and any plugins that are installed
and then do a backup of all databases and programs.&nbsp; It will only
backup changed files, so the first time it will take a while.&nbsp; Subsequent
backups will be a lot quicker.
<h3>
Restoring a Palm Pilot</h3>
This is not part of J-Pilot.&nbsp; J-Pilot stores its files in $HOME/.jpilot/.&nbsp;
To restore a palm pilot that has lost its data you can use the pilot-xfer
program that comes with pilot-link.&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is
to put every file that you want installed (or restored) back on the palm
pilot in one directory.&nbsp; For this example, a directory called backup.&nbsp;
Then you can execute "pilot-xfer -r backup".&nbsp; Do not install applications
that are already in ROM on the palm pilot, such as the Address.prc, etc.
<p>Do not try to use j-pilot to sync data back into a reset palm pilot.&nbsp;
It will overwrite the data on the desktop with the empty palm pilot files.&nbsp;
This may change in a later release.
<h3>
Plugins</h3>
Plugins are shared libraries.&nbsp; They should end with a ".so" suffix.&nbsp;
They should be placed in the ~/.jpilot/plugins/ directory, or [BASEDIR]/share/jpilot/plugins/&nbsp;
directory, where BASEDIR is the directory that J-Pilot was installed under
(default is /usr/local/).&nbsp; Once the plugin is there it will automatically
appear in the J-Pilot menu.&nbsp; If it doesn't, then that probably means
that J-Pilot was installed incorrectly, or the plugin isn't compatible.
<h3>
Feedback/Contributions</h3>
I always like to here feedback from users.&nbsp; Sometimes I get a little
busy with email and my paying job, but I should always respond.
<br>If you want to contribute some code just email me and tell me what
you want to do, or have already done, etc.&nbsp; I may like it, and I may
not.&nbsp; You are always free to do what you want to with the source code.
<br>If you really want to give me something for my effort in putting together
this program.&nbsp; You can send me a little donation.&nbsp; I collect
coins from anywhere, anytime also.

<p><b>FAQ</b>
<br><b>(Frequently Asked Questions)</b></center>

<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; Why is it called J-Pilot?&nbsp; Its not written in Java.
<p><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Originally I wrote this program for Myself and my Wife
to use.&nbsp; The J was for Judd or Jacki.&nbsp; Not much thought was put
into this.&nbsp; Then, out of the goodness of my heart, I wanted to release
it under the GPL.&nbsp; I asked around for some better names, but I didn't
come up with one.&nbsp; gtkpilot would be more appropriate, but I hate
typing gtk.
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; Why do you give it away for free?
<p><b>A:</b>&nbsp; 1. Because I can.&nbsp; 2. World Domination.
<br>I would like to see Linux, become the dominate desktop both in the
workplace and at home.&nbsp; This is one of my contributions to help make
it happen.&nbsp; The more people that use Linux at home, the more I benefit
from the hardware support and commercial software that will become available.&nbsp;
The more Linux/Unix is used in the office, the more pleasant my job becomes.&nbsp;
If I drove cars for a living, I'd rather be driving Ferraris and Corvettes
around than Chevettes and Yugos.
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; Are you going to Gnome-ify it, or KDE-ify it?
<p><b>A:</b>&nbsp; I don't run KDE, or Gnome, and at this point I don't
even know what it would take to do this.&nbsp; If someone else wants to
do this, that is ok.&nbsp; My only requirement is that KDE, or Gnome isn't
required to run J-Pilot.&nbsp; I take pride in the fact that Linux/Unix
has many window managers available to use.
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; How do I cut-and-paste?
<p><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Cut is ctrl-c and paste is ctrl-v.
