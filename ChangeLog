	* jpilot-dump.c: Resolve bug 1634 "jpilot-dump is off by 1 day"

	  dumpbook(): explicitly initialise the .tm_isdst field (daylight
	  saving time) instead of using the random value in memory

2006-02-14 15:53  rikster5

	* jpilot-dump.c, jpilot-sync.c, jpilot.c, prefs.c: Resolve Bug

2006-01-11 17:50  rikster5

	* datebook_gui.c: Work around GTK bug in nested callback routines.

	  When creating a new appt in the datebook the first time the
	  pulldown menus for setting the time are used they appear and
	  disappear.  One has to click a second time for the menus to stay
	  on the screen.  In addition, if one clicks and holds the mouse
	  the very first time then the entry for 8 am is missing in the
	  menu.  This patch fixes both items.

	  under GTK 2.8 libraries

2006-01-10 02:24  rikster5

	* Makefile.am: Add test_compile target for developers to Makefile

	  A number of simple errors would have been caught by developers
	  before patches were checked in to CVS if the build logs had been
	  searched.  I added a target which configures a GTK1 build,
	  compiles the code, and then checks for warnings and errors.  If
	  the GTK1 build passes then it does the same sequence for GTK2.

	  It is recommended to run 'make test_compile' before checking new
	  code into CVS.

	* search_gui.c: Increase keyboard functionality in search GUI.

	  Search results in clist can be scrolled through using cursor
	  keys.  Added ability to hit Enter and automatically go to the
	  currently highlighted record.  Previously one had to use the
	  mouse and click on a row in the clist to have this functionality.

2006-01-10 00:59  rikster5

	* search_gui.c: Have focus default to search entry field when the

2006-01-05 19:57  rikster5

	* datebook_gui.c: GTK uses day 0 to unselect the current calendar
	  day.	Use this fact in cb_cal_changed to avoid extra
	  clist_updates when adding a new appointment.

	* datebook_gui.c: Change a few subroutine names to be consistent
	  with other gui.c files

2006-01-05 17:52  rikster5

	* address_gui.c, datebook_gui.c: Disconnect signals when a new
	  record is added so that cb_record_changed is not called every
	  time a character is typed

2006-01-05 17:46  rikster5

	* memo_gui.c: Re-connect disconnected signals at the end of
	  memo_clear_details for consistency with other clear_details
	  subroutines

	* po/.cvsignore: add ko.gmo and uk.gmo

	  Eliminate extra spaces otherwise

2006-01-05 00:04  rikster5

	  not show a duration(time1-time1)

2006-01-01 17:36  rousseau

	* alarms.c, utils.c: Declare variables used with GTK+2 only when
	  GTK+2 is used

2006-01-01 17:33  rousseau

	* utils.h: add declaration of g_strlcpy() if GTK+1 is used

2006-01-01 17:33  rousseau

	* utils.c: add definition of g_strlcpy() when GTK+1 is used since
	  this function is new in GTK+2.

	  This is the exact copy of strlcpy() from OpenBSD with the name
	  changed ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/string/

	  this for future work.

2005-12-27 21:26  rikster5

	  Per discussion on the Jpilot message boards, all of the major
	  distros are now building Jpilot under GTK2.  The last survey of
	  users also showed 2/3 using GTK2 and 1/3 using GTK1.	GTK1 build
	  is availble by explicitly configuring with --disable-gtk2.

2005-12-03 18:16  rikster5

	* address_gui.c, datebook_gui.c, memo_gui.c, todo_gui.c: Clean
	  set_new_button code

	  Instead of trying to track deltas between old state and new state
	  I simply put up the buttons I want to display and hide the other
	  ones.  This makes the code easier to understand and there is no
	  performance penalty because a gtk_widget_hide on an already
	  hidden widget takes almost zero time.

	* address_gui.c, datebook_gui.c, memo_gui.c, todo_gui.c,
	  Expense/expense.c, KeyRing/keyring.c: Correct bug where clicking
	  on a clist row does not always send you to the correct record

	  When a record is modified, and a user clicks on a different row
	  in a clist instead of hitting the 'apply changes' button`, and
	  the user selects that the changes be saved then there is the
	  possibility that the entry that the user selected will no longer
	  be in the row that the user selected.  This is caused by the
	  addition of the new or modified record and the subsequent default
	  sorting of the clist.  The bug is corrected by finding out which
	  record, rather than which row, the user was trying to access and
	  then going to that record after the new or modified one has been
	  added.

2005-12-03 16:47  rikster5

2005-12-02 12:12  rousseau

	* alarms.c: dialog_alarm(): make the alarm window always appear and

2005-11-29 20:44  rikster5

	* utils.c: Labels in modal dialogs shouldn't be selectable.

2005-11-28 02:31  rikster5

	* category.c: Error message changed to prevent conflict with
	  existing "Edit Categories" window.

	  When editing categories and an error occurs the alert window has
	  the title "Edit Categories <2>" because the window manager has to
	  give it a unique name.  This is confusing so the alert window was
	  re-titled to "Edit Categories Error"

2005-11-28 02:22  rikster5

	  dialog_generic() has been greatly improved   . do not set the
	  window title as indicated in [1]   . do not force the dimensions
	  but let GTK+ select the correct size	 . use a bold font for the
	  title and normal text for the long error message   . do not use a
	  frame but the format specified in [2]   . use an icon (char
	  *frame_text argument now replaced by int type argument)  - the
	  password entry window has a nice icon  - the buttons
	  Delete/Copy/New now have a small space around them so they
	  look like more independent and real buttons.	[1]

	  zh_TW.po: regeneration

2004-11-21 17:07  rousseau

	* jpilot-dump.c: call otherconv_init()/otherconv_free() since we
	  indirectly will use charset conversion functions

2004-11-21 17:01  rikster5

	* jpilot.c: Test Id in header of file

2004-11-21 16:37  rousseau

	* datebook_gui.c: datebook_gui(): add a separator above the "Today
	  is:" label to be homogenous with the 3 other applications.

2004-11-21 16:34  rousseau

	* jpilot.c: main(): remove the separators above and under the lock
	  and replace them by some empty space

2004-11-21 16:14  rousseau

	  that the state is clearly indicated.

2004-11-21 15:24  rousseau

2004-11-21 08:36  rousseau

	  Carlos Z.F. Liu

2004-11-20 15:45  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): if only the last char is unknown no
	  error is generated by g_convert_with_iconv() so we must treat
	  this special case

2004-11-20 15:31  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): replace unknown characters by \xy
	  with xy the hexadecimal value of the character.  Thanks to lei Yu

2004-11-20 14:40  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): free allocated head and tail
	  variables Thanks to lei Yu for the patch

2004-11-20 14:38  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): revert patch of revision 1.5: Use
	  "UTF-8" instead of"UTF-8//IGNORE"

2004-11-20 14:08  rousseau

	* datebook_gui.c, monthview_gui.c, weekview_gui.c: the second
	  argument of get_pref() is (long *) and not (unsigned long *)

2004-11-20 12:20  rousseau

	* category.c: cb_edit_button(): cast const char *entry_text in
	  (char *) when used in charset_j2p()

2004-11-20 11:26  rousseau

	* libplugin.h: jp_charset_p2j() and jp_charset_j2p() now use (char
	  *) instead of (unsigned char *) for text strings.  This may give
	  warnings/errors when compiling plugins

2004-11-20 11:24  rousseau

	* address.c, address_gui.c, category.c, cp1250.c, cp1250.h,
	  datebook.c, datebook_gui.c, japanese.c, japanese.h, jpilot.c,
	  memo.c, memo_gui.c, otherconv.c, otherconv.h, russian.c,
	  russian.h, sync.c, todo.c, todo_gui.c, utils.c, utils.h: strings
	  convertion functions work on normal C strings (char *) not
	  (unsigned char *) We then can remove a lot of type casting

2004-11-20 06:50  rousseau

	* jpilot-dump.c: main(): current_locale was declared (after some
	  code!) but never used

2004-11-20 06:48  rousseau

	* jpilot-sync.c:  #include "otherconv.h" if ENABLE_GTK2 so that
	   otherconv_init()/otherconv_free() prototypes are defined

2004-11-20 06:41  rousseau

	* prefs_gui.c: remove 3 unused local variables

2004-11-20 06:39  rousseau

	* prefs.c:  #include "otherconv.h" if ENABLE_GTK2 so that
	  otherconv_init()
	   prototype is defined

2004-11-20 06:34  rousseau

	* jpilot.c:  #include "otherconv.h" if ENABLE_GTK2 so that
	   otherconv_init()/otherconv_free() prototypes are defined

2004-11-18 15:37  rousseau

	* category.c: edit_cats(): the max category name length is 15 and
	  not 16 (HOSTCATLTH) since we must also store the \0

2004-11-18 15:22  rousseau

	* memo.c, memo_gui.c: memo.c, get_memo_app_info(): do not modify
	  (convert) the category names memo_gui.c, memo_gui(): convert the
	  category names to jpilot charset for display only

2004-11-18 15:10  rousseau

	* po/fr.po: translate 3 strings

2004-11-17 16:16  rousseau

	* jpilot.c: remove Ctrl-A accelerator (used for "/File/Export")
	  since it collide with a GTK2 accelerator (for "select all")

2004-11-17 03:08  rikster5

	* search_gui.c: Search now prioritizes description field over note
	  field.  If search pattern appears in both description and note
	  field for a datebook appt or todo item then the search will
	  return the match from the description section.  Previously it
	  returned the match from the note field.

2004-11-17 02:54  rikster5

	* search_gui.c: Change layout of function declarations to match
	  other jpilot C files

2004-11-16 21:04  rikster5

	* datebook.c, datebook.h, search_gui.c: Fix sort order for appts in
	  datebook.  Separate sort comparison functions are now used for
	  the datebook and search GUI.

2004-11-16 12:00  rousseau

	* KeyRing/keyring.c: revert patch on DES_ecb3_encrypt() since the
	  casts are mandatory for old OpenSSL (< 0.9.7e)

2004-11-16 02:25  rikster5

	* search_gui.c: Align datebook items in search gui in a column.
	  Search items returned from datebook are not aligned properly in
	  GTK2 because it uses a proportional rather than fixed font.
	  Using a tab in place of spaces fixes the problem.

2004-11-16 01:43  rikster5

	* print.c, print_headers.c: Format postscript for calendar
	  printouts(day, week, month) to conform to standards.	Divided
	  generated postscript into prolog and setup sections per
	  postscript specifications.  Added extra comments and
	  directives(%%Orientation) which format the output for on-screen
	  postscript viewers as opposed to printing.

2004-11-14 16:09  rousseau

	* ChangeLog: version 0.99.8-pre3

2004-11-14 16:06  rousseau

	  jpilot.pot, nl.po, no.po, ru.po, sv.po, tr.po, vi.po, zh_CN.po,
	  zh_TW.po: regenerated

2004-11-14 15:21  rousseau

	* ABOUT-NLS: gettext version 0.14.1-6

2004-11-14 15:19  rousseau

	* KeyRing/keyring.c: remove cast for args 1 & 2 of
	  DES_ecb3_encrypt() since they are now useless (with OpenSSL
	  0.9.7e)

2004-11-14 14:15  rousseau

	* autogen.sh: run "aclocal -I m4" _after_ gettextize because
	  gettextize asks to:	Please run 'aclocal -I m4' to regenerate
	  the aclocal.m4 file.	  You need aclocal from GNU automake 1.5
	  (or newer) to do this.    Then run 'autoconf' to regenerate the
	  configure file.

2004-11-13 00:45  rikster5

	* datebook_gui.c: Settle on consistent name for get_details
	  subroutine across all 4 apps

2004-11-13 00:43  rikster5

	* jpilot.c: delete_event callback routine needs cb_ prefix for
	  consistency with other callback names

2004-11-12 02:24  rikster5

	* prefs_gui.c: Simplify handling of text entry boxes in prefs_gui
	  by creating a single callback routine

2004-11-12 01:40  rikster5

	* address.c, address_gui.c, alarms.c, dat.c, datebook.c,
	  datebook_gui.c, jpilot-dump.c, monthview_gui.c, print.c,
	  search_gui.c, utils.c, utils.h, weekview_gui.c: Synchronize names
	  in coding space Created standard, recognizable variable names for
	  the 4 different apps Datebook: a -> appt Address : a -> addr ToDo
	  : todo unchanged Memo    : memo unchanged

2004-11-12 01:30  rikster5

	* jpilot.c: Addendum to get pref_show_tooltips to work

2004-11-11 23:16  rikster5

	* address_gui.c, memo_gui.c, todo_gui.c: Improve code readability
	  by using variable for frequent GPOINTER_TO_INT casts

2004-11-11 23:06  rikster5

	* prefs.c, prefs.h, prefs_gui.c: New preference to show or hide
	  popup tooltips

2004-11-11 22:30  rikster5

	* datebook.c, search_gui.c: Entries returned from datebook app
	  during search were in random order.  Sort returned datebook
	  entries by ascending date.

2004-11-11 18:37  judd

	* jpilot.c: removed declarations from mid-code

2004-11-11 16:56  rikster5

	* jpilot.c, prefs_gui.c: Get first day of week from locale in GTK2,
	  no preference setting

2004-11-11 16:16  rousseau

	* po/fr.po: add a space before 'Utilisateur : ' used to create the
	  window title change some E in É

2004-11-11 16:11  judd

	* utils.c: variable declared mid code

2004-11-11 15:58  rousseau

	* po/zh_CN.po: complete review and translation.

	  Thanks to lei Yu

2004-11-11 15:55  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): in case of convertion error we
	  return a duplicate of the input and not the input directly.  This
	  bug crashed jpilot when using UTF-8: GB2312 encoding

2004-11-11 15:30  rousseau

	* import_gui.c, memo_gui.c: remove the charset conversion (for
	  display only) from import_gui.c/cb_import_record_ask_quit() and
	  instead convert the memo text itself in
	  memo_gui.c/memo_import_callback().

	  The memo is converted back from J-Pilot to Palm encoding in
	  memo.c/pc_memo_write() so we need to have it in UTF-8 for GTK2

2004-11-11 14:22  rousseau

	* import_gui.c: cb_import_record_ask_quit(): convert the imported
	  text to UTF-8 for GTK2. The source charset is the one used on the
	  Palm.

2004-11-11 09:56  rousseau

	* datebook_gui.c: create_time_menu(): use jp_strftime() to generate
	  a valid UTF-8 time string.

	  thanks to lei Yu for the patch

2004-11-11 09:54  rousseau

	* datebook_gui.c: set_begin_end_labels(): use jp_strftime() instead
	  of strftime() to generate a valid UTF-8 time string for GTK2

2004-11-11 08:16  rousseau

	* sync.c: jp_pilot_connect(): give a more explicit error message
	  when pi_bind() fails. We now have "permission denied" or "file
	  not found" instead of "Illegal seek". Also display the device
	  name we are trying to use.

	  Thanks to Edgar Bonet for the patch

2004-11-08 12:12  rikster5

	* jpilot.c: Save default output pane height if it has not been set
	  previously

2004-11-07 12:08  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): use "UTF-8//IGNORE" as tocode to
	  greatly simplify the error case management.

	  http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/documentation/libiconv/iconv_open.3.html

2004-11-06 08:48  rousseau

	* print.c: print_months_appts(): reset LC_NUMERIC locale and not
	  LC_ALL before returning

2004-11-06 08:27  rousseau

	* address_gui.c, memo_gui.c: address_update_clist() and
	  memo_update_clist(): disconnect cb_clist_selection function from
	  the clist object only for the main window and not for the export
	  window.

	  This avoids a "Gtk-WARNING **: unable to find signal handler for
	  object(GtkCList:0x821f1a8) with func(0x80837b0) and data((nil))"

2004-11-06 08:17  rousseau

	* address_gui.c: address_update_clist(): do not use the global
	  variable address_category but the function argument category.
	  The category selection was not working from the Export window.

2004-11-05 10:15  rousseau

	* utils.c: lstrncpy_remove_cr_lfs(): truncate the string on an
	  UTF-8 character boundary.  Thanks to lei Yu for the patch

2004-11-05 04:00  rousseau

	* prefs.h, otherconv.c, prefs.c: close bugs 1292 and 1138: add
	  support for Cyrillic (CP1251)

2004-11-04 16:03  rousseau

	* otherconv.c, prefs.c, prefs.h: close bug 1346: add support for
	  Hebrew (CP1255)

2004-11-04 16:02  rousseau

	* utils.c: charset_p2newj() and charset_j2p(): default charset is
	  considered to be UTF-8 since we may add a long list of them

2004-11-04 15:33  rousseau

	* otherconv.c: other_to_UTF(): cast (unsigned char*)strdup() since
	  that's the return type

2004-11-04 15:29  rousseau

	* weekview_gui.c: display_weeks_appts(): convert the week day in
	  UTF-8

2004-11-04 15:26  rousseau

	* utils.c: jp_strftime(): the "format" string argument is UTF-8
	  encoded since it comes from a po/ file. So convert it to local
	  encoding before using it in strftime().

2004-11-04 15:23  rousseau

	* po/zh_CN.po: add a leading / to the translated "/File/_Find"
	  entry

2004-11-04 15:19  rousseau

	* po/zh_CN.po: remove fuzzy for "/_File""/_File" entry translate
	  "/Help/PayBack program" and "/Help/J-Pilot" This will avoid
	  having duplicate File and Help menu entries

2004-10-30 00:47  rikster5

	* jpilot.c: Center 4 app buttons with pixpmaps to match sync and
	  backup buttons

	* reconf: remove config.status before starting autoreconf

2004-10-29 16:20  rousseau

	* Makefile.am, jpilot-sync.c, jpilot.c, otherconv.c, otherconv.h,
	  prefs.c, prefs.h, utils.c: use iconv to convert from the Palm
	  charset to UTF-8.

	  Many thanks to Amit Aronovitch for the idea and a large part of
	  the code.

2004-10-28 21:12  judd

	* todo_gui.c: Fixed bug with setting todos forward days the first
	  time the calendar widget is used

2004-10-28 16:29  rousseau

	* jpilot.c: output_to_pane(): with GTK2, insert the text at the end
	  and not at the cursor position since the user may have clicked on
	  the text and moved the cursor to the clicked position.

	  Thanks to Ari Pollak for the patch

2004-10-24 21:23  rikster5

	* address_gui.c, datebook_gui.c, memo_gui.c, todo_gui.c: Warn users
	  when modification of deleted record is attempted

2004-10-24 20:34  rikster5

	* address_gui.c: Same size mail and dial buttons in address book

	  clists.  Bug introduced when recoding update_clist() which
	  prevented the right-hand side of jpilot from being updated on a
	  cursor movement.

2004-10-22 02:54  rikster5

	* address_gui.c: datebook_gui.c

2004-10-21 19:49  judd

	  date

	* jpilot.c: keep output pane minimized until output is displayed

2004-10-17 10:51  rousseau

	* po/: ca.po, cs.po, da.po, de.po, es.po, it.po, ja.po, nl.po,
	  no.po, ru.po, sv.po, tr.po, vi.po, zh_CN.po, zh_TW.po: remove
	  fuzzy tag for "/File/_Quit" (the _ was recently added) to avoid
	  the creation of a "File" menu with "_Quit" as the only entry in
	  addition to the translated "File" menu

2004-10-17 10:26  rousseau

	* po/fr.po: translate the new strings (hot-keys tooltips + some
	  others)

2004-10-17 10:12  rousseau

	* Makefile.am: - re-add intltool-extract.in intltool-merge.in
	  intltool-update.in (my   previous patch revision 1.28 was wrong)

2004-10-16 14:32  rousseau

	* jpilot.c: add Ctrl-Y accelerator for Sync

2004-10-16 13:42  rousseau

	* KeyRing/keyring.c: cb_add_new_record(): duplicate (strdup) the
