This code is forked from dtmf-dial-0.1

I (Judd Montgomery) modified it to set the master volume before playing tones
 and then set it back to the original settings after playing the tones.
 I renamed it so as not to overwrite the dial program if installed.
 
 I did this because I noticed that the phone recognized the dtmf tones
 better at a certain volume range.
 
 These options are --lv {volume 0-100} and --rv {0-100}
 ex. jpilot-dial --lv 60 --rv 0 555-1234
  Then I can hold the phone up to the left speaker, while not making as much
  noise as if the right speaker was on also.  When its done dialing the
  volume goes back to its original setting.

Dial generates the dtmf tone signals used for telephone
dialing and by default sends the signals to the sound card.

It can be used for easy dialing, simply put the telephone
microphone near the compiter speaker and let the software
dial for you.

It is intended for dialing from within data base programs that
also store telephone numbers.

Usage:
Usually you just run need to give the phone number
that you wish to dial as an argument.
    dial 555-3456

By default the tone generated for each dialed digit is
100 milliseconds. Silence between digits is 50 milliseconds.
A comma or a blank space between digits is replaces with
a 500 milliseconds delay.

The duration values can be set by these arguments:
  --tone-time   milliseconds 	(default 100)
  --silent-time milliseconds	(default 50)
  --sleep-time  milliseconds	(default 500)

By default the output is sent to "/dev/dsp". Generated samples
are 8 bits unsigned values (AFMT_U8). 8000 samples/second.

To send the output to another device one can use the option:
  --output-dev device		(default /dev/dsp)
This option can be used also to store raw audio samples to
a file, or to stdout. Use the file name with the --output-dev
option, ir a simpe "-" to sent to stdout.
If the output device is not the sound special file then another
option should be used to eliminate attempts to set the sound
driver parameters:
  --use-audio  onoff	(default 1)
Use "--use-audio 0" to disable sound ioctls.

It is possible to generate the samples in AFMT_S16_LE format,
To do that use the option:
  --bits  bits-per-sample  (default 8)
8 will geneate AFMT_U8 format, 16 will generate AFMT_S16_LE format.

It is possible to generate samples in a different sampling rate.
To do that use the option:
  --speed sampling-rate    (default 8000)

Sound samples are generated by sub-sampling values from a cosine
table. By default the cosine table contains 256 samples.
Smaller cosine table sizes still produce the correct frequencies
but with some distortion.
These options can be used:
  --table-size size		(default 256)
The table used is of a different size
  --volume volume		(default 100)
Values stored in the table are scaled down volume/100 times
the maximum value which does not cause overflow on the 8 or
16 bit samples.

To generate a stereo sound use the options --right or
--left. By default they are 0 and a mono sample is generated.
If any of these option are 1, a stereo sample will be generated
and the corrensponding channel will be turned on.
